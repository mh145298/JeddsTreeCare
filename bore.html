<h1>Emerald Ash Borer</h1>
  <p>Emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, is an exotic beetle that was discovered in southeastern Michigan near Detroit in the summer of 2002. The adult beetles nibble on ash foliage but cause little damage. The larvae (the immature stage) feed on the inner bark of ash trees, disrupting the tree's ability to transport water and nutrients. Emerald ash borer probably arrived in the United States on solid wood packing material carried in cargo ships or airplanes originating in its native Asia. As of October 2018, it is now found in 35 states, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Manitoba.</p>
  <h2>Since its discovery, EAB has:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Killed hundreds of millions of ash trees in North America.</li>
    <li>aused regulatory agencies and the USDA to enforce quarantines and fines to prevent potentially infested ash trees, logs or hardwood firewood from moving out of areas where EAB occurs.</li>
    <li>Cost municipalities, property owners, nursery operators and forest products industries hundreds of millions of dollars.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What To Know About EAB</h2>  <img class="images"src="images/borer1.jpg" alt="">
  <ul>
    <li>Adult Beetles are metallic green and about 1/2-inch long.</li>
    <li>It attacks only ash trees (Fraxinus spp.)</li>
    <li>Adults leave a D-shaped exit hole in the bark when they emerge in spring.</li>
    <li>Woodpeckers like EAB larvae; heavy woodpecker damage on ash trees may be a sign of infestation.</li>
    <li>Firewood cannot be moved in many areas because of the EAB quarantine.</li>
    <li>It probably came from Asia in wood packing material.</li>
  </ul>
